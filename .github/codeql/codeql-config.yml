# CodeQL config centralizing query packs and path exclusions.
# We explicitly ignore generated artifacts and SARIF outputs to avoid
# wasting analysis cycles or accidentally re-importing produced results.
#
# NOTE: SARIF results are produced by the analyze step and uploaded to
# the Security tab; they should never be committed. This also prevents
# the action from trying to analyze its own prior outputs if they were
# ever added.

paths-ignore:
  - "**/*.sarif"
  - "docs/reference/api.md"
  - "docs/reference/changelog.md"
  - "docs/.generated/**"
  - "tmp-*/**"
  - "coverage/**"
# Query packs: keep default plus security-and-quality (already selected in workflow).
# Additional custom packs could be appended here later.
