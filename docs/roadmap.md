## How This Roadmap Works

The roadmap is user-facing. Engineering-level breakdowns, acceptance criteria, and granular progress live in the repository task list and issues. Completed roadmap items must correspond to checked items in `tasklist.md`; CI will flag divergence once that check is enabled.

Priorities can shift based on community feedback and operational learning. Open a discussion or issue if a feature here matters to you—especially items in the Later section.

Self-host note: All shipped features include configuration docs so you can run them privately with minimal overhead.
