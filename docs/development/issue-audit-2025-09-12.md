### 3. Consolidation Issues (8 groups)
Issues that claim to consolidate others but consolidated issues may still be open:
- #12 → consolidates #13,14,15,24,25,34

### 4. Phase 6 Checklist (25 issues #81-105)
Deployment readiness checklist imported from deprecated tasklist. Many may be outdated.

## Immediate Actions

### A. Fix Renovate Configuration ✅ COMPLETED
- Fixed invalid `:prHourlyLimit10` preset in renovate.json
- This resolves issue #11 and unblocks dependency updates

### B. Close Exact Duplicates (2 issues)
```bash
# Close #23 as duplicate of #33
# Close #22 as duplicate of #32
```

### C. Close Implemented Features (10 issues)
Based on implementation evidence:
```bash
# Close as implemented: #12, #21, #44, #67, #64, #54, #55, #58
# Note: #22, #32 already closed as duplicates above
```

## Manual Review Required

### 1. Verify Consolidation Completeness
For each consolidation issue, verify that claimed consolidated issues are actually closed:
- Review #12 and ensure #13,14,15,24,25,34 are closed
- Review #16 and ensure #17,18,26,27,28,35,36,37,39,40,42,70 are closed
- [etc. for each group]

### 2. Build System Review 
- **#16**: build-job-orchestration (basic implementation exists)
- **#38**: build-sandbox (containerization status unclear)
- **#43**: container-isolated-builds (retention policy status unclear)

### 3. Phase 6 Deployment Checklist
Issues #81-105 need systematic review against actual deployment state:
- Many appear to be final release readiness checks
- Should be evaluated against current MVP status
- Consider closing outdated items or converting to operational tasks

## Recommendations

### Short Term (This Week)
1. ✅ Fix Renovate configuration 
2. Close 2 exact duplicates
3. Close 10 implemented features  
4. Verify and close consolidated issues

### Medium Term (Next Sprint)
1. Review Phase 6 checklist against actual deployment needs
2. Evaluate build system containerization status
3. Update roadmap synchronization
4. Clean up issue labels and milestones

### Long Term  
1. Implement automated issue/roadmap synchronization
2. Create process to prevent future task list import confusion
3. Establish clear criteria for issue closure vs. implementation completion

## Impact
- **Reduced noise**: ~14-25 issues closed immediately
- **Improved focus**: Remaining issues represent actual work needed
- **Better tracking**: Roadmap accuracy improved
- **Operational health**: Dependency updates restored via Renovate fix

## Files Modified
- `renovate.json`: Fixed invalid preset configuration
- This audit document created for future reference
