\n## API Reference (Planned)  
**Status:** Planned â€“ autogenerated markdown not yet generated. Use source paths until generation script lands.

This page will host an autogenerated reference derived from the backend OpenAPI (Swagger) document.

### Planned Generation Flow

1. Backend exposes Swagger JSON (NestJS SwaggerModule setup).
2. Script (`scripts/docs/generate-openapi-md.cjs`) fetches or imports the spec.
3. Converts to segmented markdown grouped by tag (auth, deployments, projects, users).
4. Injects into this page (between managed markers) or writes multiple pages.

### Interim

For current endpoints see source in `backend/src` directories:

- Auth: `auth/`
- Deployments: `deployments/`
- Projects: `projects/`
- Users: `users/`

<!-- AUTO-API:START -->
<!-- Generated content will be inserted here by generate-openapi-md.cjs -->
<!-- AUTO-API:END -->

Add questions or endpoint requests via issues until automated reference lands.
