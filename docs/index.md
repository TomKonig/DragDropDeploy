## DragDropDeploy Documentation

Welcome to the documentation hub. This directory will evolve into a full docs site (MkDocs scaffold included). For now it organizes content previously scattered in root markdown files.

## Sections

| Area | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Getting Started | Quick intro, install & first deploy |
| Guides | Task oriented walkthroughs (forthcoming) |
| Reference | Configuration, versioning, rollback, security baseline |
| Architecture | Deep technical spec & stack rationale |
| Operations | Deployment (e.g. Coolify), backups, scaling |
| Extensibility | Plugins & i18n system |
