# Security Baseline (Pointer)

> Moved to `docs/reference/security-baseline.md`.

Edit the version under `/docs`. This root file will be removed after first published docs site.

---

This document will evolve. Current baseline principles applied or planned:

## Defense in Depth

- Run behind Traefik with separate `internal` and `proxy` networks; Postgres & Redis only on `internal`.
- No privileged containers; future hardening: read-only FS for frontend / minimal perms.
- ACME automation for TLS (staging now, production later) + fallback self-signed for offline dev.

## Least Privilege / DB

- Future: dedicated roles (migrator, app_rw, app_ro). Runtime will *not* use superuser.
- RLS to be enabled after schema stabilization; tenant scoping via session variable.
- Document JIT elevated role procedure for maintenance.
- Roles script added at `backend/prisma/db_roles.sql`; production to run via isolated migration job, not app container.
- Separate DATABASE_URLs: one for migrations (migrator), one for runtime (app_rw), optional reporting (app_ro).

## Secrets & Config

- All secrets via environment variables; encourage Docker secrets for production.
- JWT secret placeholder requires change before production (highlight in README).

## OAuth (Planned)

- Enforce state + nonce (OIDC) and minimal scopes.
- First successful OAuth login becomes operator only if no operator exists.
- Rate-limit auth initiation & callback endpoints.

## Build Isolation (Planned)

- Start with local process builds; feature flag to enable containerized isolation later.
- Resource caps & timeouts on build jobs before enabling multi-tenant mode.

## Logging & Privacy

- Build logs stored without secrets; redaction layer to be added for env values.

## Supply Chain

- CI includes (commented) Snyk steps; to activate once SNYK_TOKEN secret provided.
- Pin base images (node:20-alpine, nginx:1.27-alpine, postgres:16-alpine, redis:7-alpine, traefik:v3.0).

## Next Steps (Security)

- Implement DB role creation migration scripts.
- Add rate limiting middleware (login/build trigger) before public release.
- Add Helmet & stricter CORS config when API domain finalized.
- Add automated dependency audit gating high severity vulnerabilities.
- Re-enable docker internal network isolation for Postgres/Redis; provide host access via ephemeral migration sidecar.
- Replace plaintext role passwords with secrets manager or Docker/K8s secrets.

## Container Runtime Hardening: Seccomp & AppArmor (Reference)

Baseline Docker defaults already apply a seccomp profile that blocks dangerous syscalls. For production we recommend:

1. Keep default (docker/default) unless a specific required syscall is blocked.
2. Introduce a restricted custom profile for statically served frontend & build workers once syscall set observed.

### Seccomp

Example `seccomp.json` (very small excerpt â€“ allow common, explicitly deny ptrace):

```json
{
	"defaultAction": "SCMP_ACT_ERRNO",
	"archMap": [{ "architecture": "SCMP_ARCH_X86_64", "subArchitectures": ["SCMP_ARCH_X86", "SCMP_ARCH_X32"] }],
	"syscalls": [
		{ "names": ["read", "write", "exit", "futex", "clone", "execve", "openat", "close", "statx"], "action": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW" },
		{ "names": ["ptrace"], "action": "SCMP_ACT_ERRNO" }
	]
}
```

Compose usage (optional override):

```yaml
services:
	api:
		security_opt:
			- seccomp:./hardening/seccomp-api.json
	frontend:
		security_opt:
			- seccomp:unconfined # only temporarily during troubleshooting
```

### AppArmor

On hosts with AppArmor (Ubuntu): create a profile `dragdropdeploy-api` limiting file paths and network:

Example minimal profile snippet (not exhaustive):

```text
	profile dragdropdeploy-api flags=(attach_disconnected) {
		network,
		capability net_bind_service,
		file,
		umount,
		deny ptrace (trace),
	}
```

Compose reference:

```yaml
services:
	api:
		security_opt:
			- apparmor:dragdropdeploy-api
```

### Operational Notes

- Start with monitoring mode: run container with profile and watch denials (`journalctl -k | grep DENIED`).
- Maintain separate profiles for: api, frontend (static), worker (broader build commands). Worker profile will loosen exec/bind mounts when build isolation enabled.
- Document how to temporarily relax: set `seccomp:unconfined` or remove AppArmor opt, then revert and tighten profile after adding missing safe syscalls/files.

These references satisfy the checklist item to provide an initial seccomp/AppArmor baseline without over-constraining early development.
